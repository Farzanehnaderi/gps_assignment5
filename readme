## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is part of Assignment 5 in the GPS course and focuses on **epoch-by-epoch extraction and visualization** of `C1C pseudorange` measurements from RINEX 3.02 observation files. The tool supports:

- Header parsing for satellite and observation metadata  
- Epoch-wise extraction of C1C values  
- Data filtering and transformation into a structured DataFrame  
- Interactive plotting of satellite pseudorange over time  
- Exporting results into a clean CSV report  
- A modern **PyQt5 GUI** for intuitive analysis

> 📍 Focused exclusively on GPS satellites (`Gxx`) using `C1C` observation type.

## 🎨 Plot Preview

* X-axis: UTC Time
* Y-axis: Pseudorange in meters
* Colored lines per satellite
* Max value annotation for primary satellite

---

## 📚 Academic Context

This application simulates a **space mission control scenario (SPOC)** where precise satellite measurements are required for navigation and position estimation. Only GPS satellites are used, and raw `C1C pseudorange` values are parsed directly from RINEX headers and observation records.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* `Python 3.10+`
* `PyQt5` — GUI Framework
* `matplotlib` — Scientific plotting
* `pandas` — Data transformation
* `datetime` — Time handling

---

## 🧪 Example Mission Use Case

Imagine you're on a satellite control team receiving raw GPS data in RINEX format. This tool helps you:

* Confirm data quality
* Visualize satellite coverage and signal stability
* Preprocess pseudorange for further position estimation
